## 1. Introduction
This is a small project providing a basic interface to scrape IELTS Speaking questions from [IELTS Bro](https://next.ieltsbro.com/forecast/) and random questions for me to practice while I was learning IElTS several years ago. Nowadays, people tend to effectively practice with some powerful AI Agents instead of this classic way.
